# Coverage Unit Test build recipe
#
# This CMake file contains the recipe for building the sample unit tests.
# It is invoked from the parent directory when unit tests are enabled.

#
# NOTE on the subdirectory structures here:
#
# - "inc" provides local header files shared between the coveragetest,
#    wrappers, and overrides source code units
# - "coveragetest" contains source code for the actual unit test cases
#    The primary objective is to get line/path coverage on the FSW 
#    code units.
# - "wrappers" contains wrappers for the FSW code.  The wrapper adds
#    any UT-specific scaffolding to facilitate the coverage test, and
#    includes the unmodified FSW source file.
#
 
set(UT_NAME sample_app)

# Use the UT assert public API, and allow direct
# inclusion of source files that are normally private

include_directories(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/fsw/src)
include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/inc)

# Generate a dedicated "testrunner" executable that executes the tests for each FSW code unit
# Although sample_app has only one source file, this is done in a loop such that 
# the general pattern should work for several files as well.
