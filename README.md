# Core Flight System : Framework : App : Sample

This repository contains a sample application (sample_app), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This sample application is a non-flight example application implementation for the cFS Bundle. It is intended to be located in the `apps/sample_app` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree. The Core Flight System is bundled at <https://github.com/nasa/cFS> (which includes sample_app as a submodule), which includes build and execution instructions.

sample_app is an example for how to build and link an application in cFS. See also the skeleton_app (<https://github.com/nasa/skeleton_app>) if you are looking for a bare-bones application to which to add your business logic.

## Version History

### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev66

-  Implement Coding Standard in CodeQL workflow

### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev62

- Removes app registration call, `CFE_ES_RegisterApp()` since applications do not need to register themselves.
- Apply standard header guard on all header files by removing leading underscore. Convert file-scope block comments to doxygen format.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/145>


### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev56

- Replaces <> with " in local includes
- Adds CONTRIBUTING.md that links to the main cFS contributing guide.
- Adds a description for the requirements of command and telemetry Message IDs to explain why the Msg IDs have those requirements in documentation.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/137>

### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev48

- Simplify build to use wrappers and interface libs
- Add Testing Tools to the Security Policy
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/130>

### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev37

- Documentation: Add `Security.md` with instructions on reporting vulnerabilities
- Resolves bug where success code was reported as an error for `CFE_TBL_GetAddress`.
- Rename `UT_ClearForceFail` as `UT_ClearDefaultValue` given change from <https://github.com/nasa/osal/issues/724>
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/121>

### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev29

- Aligns messages according to changes in cFE <https://github.com/nasa/cFE/issues/1009>. Uses the "raw" message cmd/tlm types in definition
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/114>


### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev25

- Rename `UT_SetForceFail` to `UT_SetDefaultReturnValue` since some functions that retain more than 1 value are not necessarily failing
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/113>


### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev22

- Replaces deprecated SB API's with MSG
- No impact, removes undesirable pattern use of `OS_PACK`
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/108>

### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev18

- No behavior changes. All identifiers now use the prefix `SAMPLE_APP_`. Changes the name of the main function from SAMPLE_AppMain to SAMPLE_APP_Main which affects the CFE startup script.
- Set REVISION to "99" to indicate development version status
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/102>

### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev13

- Unit test MID string format now 32bit
- Installs unit test to target directory
- Checks only format string in UT event test
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/98>

### Development Build: v1.2.0-rc1+dev5

- Applies standard coding style.
- Removes test code call of CFE_SB_InitMsg and sets the API/stub buffers directly.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/93>

### Development Build: 1.1.0+dev65

- Add build number and baseline to version report
- Install unit test as part of cmake recipe. Sample app test runner now shows up in expected install directory
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/86>

### Development Build: 1.1.11

- Move the table to fsw/tables and renames "sample_table" to "sample_app_table
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/76>

### Development Build: 1.1.10

- Test cases now compare an expected event string with a string derived from the spec string and arguments that were output by the unit under test.
- Replace references to `ccsds.h` types with the `cfe_sb.h`-provided type.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/71>

### Development Build: 1.1.9

- Applies the CFE_SB_MsgIdToValue() and CFE_SB_ValueToMsgId() routines where compatibility with an integer MsgId is necessary - syslog prints, events, compile-time MID #define values.
- No more format conversion error in RTEMS build
- See <https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/pull/63>

### Development Build: 1.1.8
